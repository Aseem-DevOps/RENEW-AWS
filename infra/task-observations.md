# Task Observations: Terraform Infrastructure Assessment

## 1. Review of Provided `main.tf` and Identified Issues

- **Security Flaws:**
  - Overly permissive security groups (0.0.0.0/0 for all ports)
  - No encryption at rest/in transit for S3, RDS, or logs
  - IAM roles/policies not following least privilege
  - No audit logging (CloudTrail missing)
  - Database exposed to public internet
- **Reliability & Scalability Gaps:**
  - No multi-AZ networking or resources
  - No auto-scaling for EC2 or database
  - No health checks for ALB/ASG
  - No backup or retention for RDS
- **Best Practice Violations:**
  - Monolithic, non-modular code
  - Hardcoded values, no use of variables/outputs
  - No tagging or environment separation
  - No state management backend
- **Operational Shortcomings:**
  - No monitoring, alerting, or log retention
  - No cost controls or budgets
  - No documentation or architecture overview
- **API/ML Gaps:**
  - No API Gateway rate limiting or API key auth
  - No Lambda for inference
  - No S3 versioning for model storage

## 2. Improved Version & Solutions

- **Security:**
  - Hardened security groups, least privilege IAM, encryption everywhere, CloudTrail enabled, private RDS
- **Reliability:**
  - Multi-AZ VPC, ALB, ASG, health checks, RDS backups, point-in-time recovery
- **Best Practices:**
  - Modularized all resources, variables/outputs, tagging, environment separation, remote backend example
- **Operational:**
  - CloudWatch monitoring, log retention, alerting, AWS Budgets, runbook, cost estimation
- **API/ML:**
  - API Gateway with key/rate limiting, Lambda for inference, S3 versioning, batch support noted
- **Optional/Advanced:**
  - ECS/ECR, ALB weighted routing, all modules referenced and ready

## 3. Documented Changes (with Comments)

- **What was wrong:** See above issues list
- **Why it was a problem:** Security/compliance risks, lack of HA/DR, hard to maintain, not production-ready
- **How solution fixes it:**
  - Modular, secure, scalable, and observable infrastructure
  - All AWS best practices and requirements addressed
  - Documentation and cost estimation included

## 4. Solution Structure

- `infra/` directory with modular Terraform code
- Each AWS resource as a reusable module
- Root config wires up all modules and variables
- All variables documented with sample values
- Documentation: IMPROVEMENTS.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, RUNBOOK.md, task-observations.md
- Example backend.tf for state management

## 5. Additional Components Included

- CloudTrail, CloudWatch, AWS Budgets, ECS/ECR, ALB weighted routing
- Cost estimation and operational runbook
- Guidance for environment separation and state management
- All modules ready for future extensibility
