# Issues in main-old.tf

Here are the main issues found in your `main-old.tf` file:

1. **Security Risks:**
   - The security group allows all inbound TCP traffic from anywhere (`0.0.0.0/0` on all ports), which is a major security risk.
   - The S3 bucket uses `public-read-write` ACL, making it accessible and writable by anyone.
   - Sensitive data (API keys, DB passwords) are hardcoded in `user_data`, Lambda environment, and outputs, which is unsafe.

2. **IAM Policy Problems:**
   - The IAM role policy for `model_api_policy` uses `"Effect": "*"` and `"Action": ["*"]`, which is invalid and overly permissive. `"Effect"` should be `"Allow"` or `"Deny"`.
   - The Lambda function uses an outdated runtime (`python2.7`), which is deprecated and insecure.

3. **Resource Configuration Issues:**
   - The RDS instance is publicly accessible (`publicly_accessible = true`) and uses a weak password.
   - The DB subnet group uses only a single public subnet, which is not recommended for production databases.
   - The EC2 instance profile is referenced before its definition (should be defined before the instance).

4. **Best Practices Violations:**
   - Hardcoded values for sensitive information and resource names.
   - No use of variables or outputs for dynamic configuration.
   - No resource dependencies (`depends_on`) are specified where needed.
   - No backend configuration for state management.

5. **Output Issues:**
   - The `api_key` output exposes a sensitive value.

6. **General:**
   - Some resources (like the Lambda function) reference roles or files that may not exist or are not defined in the file.
   - No resource for private subnets or NAT gateway for secure networking.

Let me know if you want recommendations or fixes for any of these issues.
