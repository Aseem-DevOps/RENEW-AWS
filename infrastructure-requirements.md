# Model API Infrastructure Requirements

## Business Context

Your organization needs to deploy a machine learning model serving API that will:
- Serve predictions from trained ML models to internal and external clients
- Handle 100-10,000 requests per minute with variable traffic patterns
- Store model artifacts (ranging from 100MB to 5GB per model)
- Maintain model metadata and request logs in a database
- Provide 99.9% availability SLA
- Support A/B testing between different model versions

## Technical Requirements

### API Requirements
- RESTful API with JSON request/response format
- Sub-second response time for 95th percentile
- Support for batch predictions (up to 100 items per request)
- API key based authentication for external clients
- Rate limiting per client

### Model Storage
- Secure storage for proprietary ML models
- Version control for models
- Fast retrieval (models should be cached after first load)
- Support for multiple model formats (TensorFlow, PyTorch, ONNX)

### Database Requirements
- Store model metadata (version, training metrics, deployment history)
- Log all prediction requests and responses
- Query capability for analytics
- Data retention for 90 days

### Security Requirements
- All data encrypted in transit and at rest
- No public internet exposure for databases
- Least privilege access principles
- Audit logging for all infrastructure changes
- Compliance with SOC 2 requirements

### Operational Requirements
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Blue-green deployments for zero-downtime updates
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting
- Automated backups with point-in-time recovery
- Cost visibility and optimization

### Performance Requirements
- Auto-scale based on CPU and memory metrics
- Handle traffic spikes of 5x normal load
- Geographic distribution not required (single region is fine)
- Cold start time under 30 seconds for new instances

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must use AWS services
- Infrastructure as Code using Terraform
- Container-based deployments preferred
- Python-based model serving framework

### Business Constraints
- Target monthly infrastructure cost under $5,000 at expected load
- Must be production-ready within 30 days
- Minimal operational overhead (small DevOps team)

## Success Criteria

1. **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities, follows AWS Well-Architected Framework
2. **Reliability**: Achieves 99.9% uptime, handles failures gracefully
3. **Performance**: Meets response time SLAs under peak load
4. **Cost**: Optimized for the expected usage patterns
5. **Maintainability**: Easy to update, monitor, and troubleshoot

## Out of Scope

- CI/CD pipeline implementation (assume GitHub Actions)
- Application code (focus on infrastructure only)
- Multi-region deployment
- Edge/CDN deployment
- Real-time streaming predictions

## Deliverables Expected

1. Production-ready Terraform configuration
2. Clear documentation of architecture decisions
3. Security analysis and remediation
4. Cost estimation for typical usage
5. Operational runbook basics
